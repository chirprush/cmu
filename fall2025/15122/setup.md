# Setup

SSH as usual into `<AndrewID>@linux.andrew.cmu.edu`

To verify X forwarding, use the following to open a window of an image
```
display ~akohlbre/pub/122.png &
```

For editing with my preexisting config, I prefer loading the AFS directory
into a local directory using `sshfs` and then editing as per usual.
