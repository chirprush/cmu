"Why A.I. Didn't Transform Our Lives in 2025"
Cal Newport (Dec 27, 2025)
The New Yorker

**Main Claim:** AI expectations and claims from big tech leaders are
simply unrealistic; we must instead reign in our expectations on AI.

- Tech leaders claim that agents will replace workforce and be able to perform
  complicated tasks (like interacting with websites and such)
- In reality, AI agents do not live up to the hype outside of (largely)
  programming (the tasks are much more technically complicated and what we
  currently have requires a lot more refining)
- Also touches upon safety: agents might even propel hallucinations, and when
  it comes to important tasks, this could be harmful
- Instead argues a more leaned-back opinion on AI agents: our lives *may*
  transform gradually over the decade, but there is still much to see and work
  on.

Shows this through the example of AI agent automatically booking a hotel for a
trip
